                  &emsp;&emsp;Each One Teach One is a simple technique for imparting small pieces of understanding to a
                  group—one student at a time. Each student confronts new information, learns it, and then is
                  empowered to teach it to each other student. It allows the student to understand better and
                  provides the learner with rare one-on-one attention and lets students select
                  “lessons/Modules” appropriate to particular student learning styles, energy levels, and
                  personalities.
